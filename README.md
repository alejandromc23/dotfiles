# Dotfiles Repository

Welcome to my dotfiles repository! Here you will find all the configurations and settings that I use on my Linux machine.

## Supported Operating Systems

Currently, the dotfiles are only prepared for Linux, but who knows... That's why there's a folder called `os`. 

## Credits

For building this dotfiles, I have used different resources to know how to structure, install and config my applications. Here are some of the resources that helped me:

- [rgomezcasas](https://github.com/rgomezcasas/dotfiles) and [CodelyTV](https://github.com/CodelyTV/dotfiles) for their dotfiles configurations, which served as the basis for the structure of this repository. 
- [Aaronidas](https://github.com/Aaronidas/my-workstation) for providing an easy and simple way on how to effectively install all the applications
- [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles), [thelinuxcast](https://gitlab.com/thelinuxcast/my-dots/-/tree/master), and the [Low Level Learning](https://www.youtube.com/c/LowLevelLearning) YouTube channel for giving me the knowledge about how to customize and optimize my setup. Some parts of the configuration in this repository are based on their work.

## Contributing
